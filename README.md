# Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) in Go

Welcome to the BDD in Go Integration Meetup! In this session, we'll explore how to implement BDD using Go, integrate with tools, and connect with other systems. This README contains resources and links to help you dive deeper into the topics we discussed.

### Introduction to BDD

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is an agile software development process that encourages collaboration between developers, testers, and non-technical or business participants in a software project.

For more information, you can check this BDD documentation:

- [Cucumber Docs: BDD Overview](https://cucumber.io/docs/bdd/)

### BDD in Go: Key Concepts

BDD in Go can be implemented using several libraries and frameworks. We'll focus on the *Godog* framework, which integrates with Cucumber.

Here are some key concepts from our discussion:

- **Gherkin Syntax:** A plain-text language used to define test cases in BDD.
    - [Cucumber Docs: Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/)
- **Godog Framework:** A Cucumber implementation in Go.
    - [Godog GitHub Repo](https://github.com/cucumber/godog)

Example from the meetup:
```gherkin
@sanity
Scenario: Worker wants to print a document
  Given: A workstation, a printer
  When: Worker clicks "print" button
  Then: Printer actually prints
```

Corresponding Go code example:
```go
sc.Step(`^worker clicks \"(print|cancel)\" button$`, clickPerformed)

func clickPerformed(ctx context.Context, ...) (context.Context, error) {
    // your code logic
}
```

### Tools for BDD in Go

Several tools can help integrate BDD into your Go projects. Below are the most popular ones we covered:

- **Godog:** BDD framework for Go.
    - [GitHub - Godog](https://github.com/cucumber/godog)
- **Cucumber Plugin for Go:** An IDE plugin to help write and run BDD tests.
    - [Cucumber Go Plugin for JetBrains](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/24323-cucumber-go/versions/stable)

### Orchestration and Infrastructure

In more complex testing environments, orchestration becomes crucial. During the meetup, we discussed how to dynamically build and run environments using **runnable units** and **bundles**. These abstractions allow you to simulate complex infrastructure setups needed for testing.

#### Runnable Units
- A **Runnable Unit** represents a piece of infrastructure where tests are executed. This can be a Docker container, a database, or a mock service.
- Each unit implements an interface with essential methods like `Build`, `Start`, and `Remove`.  
  Example:
  ```go
  type Runnable interface {
      Build() error
      Start() error
      Remove() error
      ID() string
      Status() (Status, error)
  }
  ```

#### Bundles
- A **Bundle** is a collection of runnable units. The bundle ensures all units are ready before tests run. For example, starting a Docker container for each unit and checking its status.
  ```go
  type Bundle interface {
      Add(r Runnable) error
      GetUnits() map[string]Runnable
      GetUnit(id string) (Runnable, bool)
      Remove(id string) error
  }
  ```

This modular approach allows you to:
- **Reuse bundles between runs** for faster test execution.
- Support specific use cases like **zero-downtime upgrades** by grouping infrastructure components.
